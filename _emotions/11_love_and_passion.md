The emotions surrounding passion and love of the forests and trees is what has kept many of the research participants going towards the restoration of the American Chestnut. Many using non-verbal hand gestures emphasizing their passion for being outdoors and loving trees was present in many of the interviews.

Similarly to the emotional political ecology of excitement, having a love and passion is a common tie to continue towards a shared mission of having Chestnuts reinstated in the Appalachian culture. However, unlike excitement, the passion for trees was extremely personal for many of the participants:

One of the most abundant emotional political ecologies was this love and passion held at the individual level as well as partially at the community level of living in the forests of Central Appalachia. When the Chestnut died, the entire multispecies assemblage composing the biodiversity of the forests did not all go away as well.

However, the love for the forests is what has kept the participants going in the search of a blight resistant tree either through finding a population of remnant trees with natural resistance or a new type of resistance using genetic engineering. However, the emotions involved could, in one way, distract from the biopolitical and racialized undertones of the restoration projects (Biermann, 2014).
