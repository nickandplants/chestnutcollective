 The excitement is rendered political when considered the American Chestnut Foundations' interests in restoring the Chestnut as they require individuals to be excited for the continuation of their mission through securing donations and membership. Excitement was also illustrated when attending a botanical-focused hike in Appalachia and the excitement during the search for saplings
 
 Among many other exciting moments of finding certain species of plants, the first moment when someone spotted a Chestnut sapling, everyone gathered around the individual to investigate the presence or absence of the Blight, what condition the sapling was in, and if there were others around. This highlights the intensity of the Blight's presence in Appalachian minds as the hikers' first thought was to look for the fungus, but also enchantment with wanting to find other Chestnuts living with the individual found.
