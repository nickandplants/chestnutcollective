An unexpected emotional political ecology surrounding the current status of the Chestnut remnants was the emotion of anxiety. Sara shared that when she used to go hiking in areas where Chestnut saplings could be living, she "can't go into the woods without looking for Chestnuts." After feeling emotions of anxiety, she even went to the point of

Both Terry and Sara expressed emotions of anxiousness through an anticipation of the unknown whether that be the presence/absence of a Chestnut sapling in the forest or the future of the Chestnut restoration.

Anxiety in the Anthropocene is a blossoming field of inquiry with fascinating results from Robbins and Moore (2012) where they postulate disorders stemming from living in and through the Anthropocene. 

The emotional political ecology of Chestnut adds to these conversations through the ways individuals in Appalachia shape the ongoing story of the American Chestnut through anxiously restoring and/or imagining the potential return of the species.
