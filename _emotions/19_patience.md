When considering the emotional political ecologies of the restoration process, Sara discussed how:

["tree breeding has made me much more patient because it just requires time requires time to grow trees to make trees it takes them a long time to flower and I mean there are techniques to reduce the amount of time for all of those things but it's still a lot easier or a lot harder to work with and say Arabidopsis or Tomatoes or Corn, you know, and so tree breeding in general has taught me a lot of patience."]({{'/items/chestnut051.html#chestnut05140' | relative_url}})

When considering the emotions of patience in the political ecology of the Chestnut restoration, varying scales and senses of time reveal the challenges of restoring a species of tree rather than a different species of plant or animal with shorter life-spans and (more importantly for restoration) time to sexual maturity. Ideas of patience become required when restoring a species that works in a different time scale, as some more-than-human geographers term this "tree time" (Dyke, Geoghegan, and Bruin, 2018).

Prior to the blight introduction, there was patience needed in growing trees for harvest, nut-production, or shade, but now there is a shift in what the emotion is needed for--restoration. The ideas of "tree time" have profound implications on funding cycles for obtaining grants, timelines for developing a blight resistant tree, and even finding the next generation of Chestnut enthusiasts to carry on the missions of the organization as the Chestnut tree lives much longer than a human. All of these require the emotional political ecology of patience for having success in restoration.
