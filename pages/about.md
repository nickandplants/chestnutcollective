## About the Chestnut Collection

The main, overarching question driving the entire investigation is trying to uncover the sociocultural and sociopolitical implications of the Chestnut Blight and subsequent loss of the American Chestnut on Appalachian families and communities. This question will be explored in all three chapters but especially chapter two (describing the changes starting in the past up to the present). To support and fully answer the main overarching question, I have identified secondary questions to be more precise and focused in my data collection and analysis. The first will be identifying the historical relationships and representations between the American Chestnut and people in Appalachia, which forms the focus of chapter one (past relationships). Lastly, in chapter three (present), I hope to represent what human-plant ecological assemblages are currently emerging from the blight infected habitats/remnant saplings as well as what is filling the American Chestnutâ€™s sociocultural gap in Appalachian communities as it was disappearing.
